# SSL CONNECTION ISSUE - FIXED! ✅

## What Was Wrong

The script was forcing SSL connection, but your database doesn't require it (probably local dev database).

## What I Fixed

Updated **3 files** to auto-detect SSL:
- `/scripts/setup-database.js` ✅
- `/scripts/verify-database.js` ✅
- `/lib/db.ts` ✅

Now they automatically:
- Use SSL if connecting to Heroku Postgres
- Skip SSL if connecting to local database

---

## Try Again Now! 🚀

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

This should work now!

## What Database Are You Using?

The script detected you're using a **local database** (not Heroku).

### If You Want to Use Heroku Database:

1. Get your Heroku DATABASE_URL:
   ```bash
   heroku config:get DATABASE_URL -a walla-walla-travel
   ```

2. Add it to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   echo "DATABASE_URL=postgres://..." >> .env.local
   ```

3. Run setup again:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

### If You Want to Use Local Database:

That's fine! The script should work now with local database.
