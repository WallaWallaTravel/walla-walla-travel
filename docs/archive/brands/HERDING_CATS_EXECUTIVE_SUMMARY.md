### **Voice & Tone:**

**5 Core Attributes:**

1. **VERBOSE & ARTICULATE**
   - Use more words than necessary (it's charming)
   - "We shall collect your party from the designated coordinates..."

2. **DRY WIT**
   - British comedy, not slapstick
   - Humor delivered with straight face

3. **WINE-EDUCATED**
   - Discuss malolactic fermentation casually
   - Use terroir, varietal, tannin structure naturally

4. **FELINE METAPHORS (SUBTLE)**
   - "Much like our feline namesakes..."
   - Never forced cat puns

5. **SELF-AWARE**
   - Acknowledge task is technically impossible
   - "We persist regardless"

---

## 🚫 **ABSOLUTE DON'TS (CRITICAL)**

**These will destroy the brand instantly:**

❌ "Purr-fect" or "Paw-some" puns  
❌ Cartoon cats or clip art  
❌ Bright, playful colors  
❌ Casual slang ("Super fun!" "Amazing!")  
❌ Party bus energy or bachelorette focus  
❌ Stock photography  
❌ Compromising on sophistication  

**One mistake and wineries think you're a joke.**

## 💰 **ECONOMICS**

### **Pricing Strategy: PREMIUM**

**The Pedigree Experience (6 hours, 2-6 guests):**
- From $520 (party of 4, Sun-Wed)
- ~$130/person
- Justification: Advanced Sommelier expertise + customization

**The Independent Spirit Tour (7-8 hours, 2-8 guests):**
- From $650 (party of 4)
- ~$162/person
- Premium positioning, complex coordination

**Why This Works:**
- Advanced Sommelier certification justifies premium
- Customization (not pre-packaged) = higher value
- Group dynamic management = unique service
- Sophisticated brand attracts customers who don't price-shop

- Website (template): $500-1,000
- Photography: $500-1,000
- Domain/email/tools: $100-300

**Optimal Launch:** $8,500-13,300
- Logo (premium): $1,500-2,500

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

**Don't launch until ready. Reputation is everything.**

---

### **3. Winery Relationships Are Everything**

- Sophisticated brand attracts sophisticated customers
- Premium pricing filters appropriately

**2. Defensible Advantages**
