# 🐱 Herding Cats Wine Tours - Launch Roadmap
**From Brand Guidelines to Live Business**

## 📋 **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Herding Cats Wine Tours positions itself at the intersection of:
- **Sommelier-Level Wine Expertise** (Advanced certification, real knowledge)
- **Sophisticated Humor** (New Yorker cartoon aesthetic, not party bus)
- **Premium Service** (customized itineraries, group dynamic management)

**Target Customer:** Wine-educated individuals 30-60 who appreciate dry wit, value expertise, and understand that good humor doesn't require exclamation points.

**Pricing Strategy:** Premium ($130-165/person for 6-hour tours) justified by expertise and customization.

**Competitive Advantage:** Actual sommeliers + group psychology expertise + self-aware branding = defensible market position.

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

**The brand works ONLY if executed flawlessly:**

❌ **This Kills the Brand:**

- Mediocre wine knowledge
- Party bus vibes

✅ **This Builds the Brand:**
- Consistent sophisticated voice

### **3. GROUP MANAGEMENT IS CORE COMPETENCY**

**Skills Required:**
