# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Implementation

## ✅ TDD Infrastructure Complete

### 1. **Testing Framework**
- **Jest** + **React Testing Library** for component tests
- **Coverage requirements**: 80% lines, 70% branches/functions
- **Test runners**: `npm test`, `npm test:watch`, `npm test:coverage`

### 2. **Pre-Commit Enforcement**
```bash
# Automatically runs on every commit:
1. All tests must pass
2. Coverage thresholds must be met
3. Linting must pass
4. Only then can code be committed
```

### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Runs on all PRs and pushes to main/develop
- Includes:
  - Unit tests on Node 18.x and 20.x
  - Security tests
  - TypeScript type checking
  - Code coverage reporting

### 4. **Test Structure**
```
__tests__/
├── app/           # Page component tests
├── lib/           # Utility function tests  
├── security/      # Security-specific tests
└── components/    # Reusable component tests
```

## 📋 TDD Rules Going Forward

### For Developers:

1. **Write Tests First**
   ```typescript
   // 1. Write the test
   it('should validate email format', () => {
     expect(validateEmail('test@example.com')).toBe(true)
   })
   
   // 2. Run test (it fails - red)
   // 3. Write minimal code to pass
   // 4. Run test (it passes - green)  
   // 5. Refactor if needed
   ```

2. **No Code Without Tests**
   - Every new feature must have tests
   - Every bug fix must have a regression test
   - Pre-commit hooks will block commits without tests

3. **Coverage Requirements**
   - Minimum 80% line coverage
   - Minimum 70% branch coverage
   - Run `npm run test:coverage` to check

4. **Test Naming Convention**
   ```typescript
   describe('ComponentName', () => {
     it('should [expected behavior] when [condition]', () => {
       // test implementation
     })
   })
   ```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for TDD)
npm test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test -- __tests__/app/login/page.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run security tests only
npm run test:security
```

### Writing New Features
1. Create test file: `__tests__/[path]/[component].test.tsx`
2. Write failing tests for requirements
3. Implement feature until tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

### Pre-Commit Checks
When you commit, these run automatically:
- ✅ All tests must pass
- ✅ Coverage thresholds met
- ✅ Linting passes
- ✅ TypeScript compiles

If any fail, the commit is blocked.

## 🛡️ Enforcement Mechanisms

1. **Local Enforcement**
   - Husky pre-commit hooks
   - Tests run before every commit
   - Cannot push failing tests

2. **CI/CD Enforcement**  
   - GitHub Actions runs all tests
   - PRs cannot merge with failing tests
   - Coverage reports on every PR

3. **IDE Integration**
   - VS Code Jest extension recommended
   - See test status in real-time
   - Run/debug tests from editor

## 📊 Current Coverage

Run `npm run test:coverage` to see current coverage:
- Target: 80% statements, 80% lines, 70% branches, 70% functions
- Security tests: 100% coverage on critical paths

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

1. **Weekly Reviews**
   - Check coverage trends
   - Identify untested code
   - Add missing tests

2. **Test Quality**
   - Tests should be readable
   - Tests should be maintainable
   - Tests should catch real bugs

3. **Performance**
   - Keep test suite fast (<5 minutes)
   - Parallelize where possible
   - Mock external dependencies

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Never skip tests** to make commits
- **Fix failing tests** before adding features
- **Update tests** when changing behavior
- **Write integration tests** for critical flows

TDD is now enforced and will ensure code quality going forward!
