## üîê Password Manager Sharing (Recommended for Teams)

If using a password manager (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden):

1. Create a shared vault named "Walla Walla Travel - Drivers"
2. Add each driver's credentials
3. Share only with that specific driver
4. Set expiration on temporary passwords
5. Track when they've changed it

```bash
# Check login activity (run in production database)
SELECT
  email,
  name,
  last_login,
  CASE
    WHEN last_login IS NULL THEN '‚ùå Never logged in'
    WHEN last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours' THEN '‚úÖ Recent login'

  END as status
FROM users

ORDER BY last_login DESC NULLS LAST;
```

**Expected timeline:**
