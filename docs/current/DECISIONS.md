# üß† ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORDS (ADRs)
**Purpose:** Document WHY we made key technical decisions to prevent re-litigating them later.

---

## Decision Format

Each decision should answer:
1. **Context:** What's the problem we're solving?
2. **Decision:** What did we choose?
3. **Rationale:** Why did we choose this?
4. **Consequences:** What are the trade-offs?
5. **Alternatives Considered:** What else did we evaluate?

## üìã Active Decisions

### **ADR-001: Remove Supabase, Use Cookie-Based Auth**
**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Context:**
- Original app used Supabase for auth & database
- Supabase dependencies caused build failures
- App needs to work without external auth service

**Decision:**
- Removed all Supabase packages
- Implemented cookie-based session management
- Use `lib/auth.ts` for authentication logic

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies deployment (no external dependencies)
- Reduces costs (no Supabase subscription needed)
- Full control over auth flow
- Works offline/locally

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Build now passes (4.5s compile)
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies
- ‚úÖ Simpler architecture
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement own password hashing
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add CSRF protection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to add rate limiting

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Keep Supabase:** Rejected due to build issues, cost, complexity
- **NextAuth.js:** Rejected due to similar complexity, still requires database
- **Custom JWT:** Rejected in favor of simpler cookie sessions

**Follow-up Work:**
- [ ] Add bcrypt password hashing
- [ ] Implement CSRF tokens
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware

### **ADR-002: Mobile-First Design with 48px Touch Targets**
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Context:**
- Primary users are drivers using phones
- Drivers wear gloves in winter
- One-handed operation required while holding clipboard

**Decision:**
- All touch targets minimum 48px height
- Primary actions in bottom 20% of screen
- High contrast text (WCAG AAA)
- Haptic feedback on interactions

**Rationale:**
- iOS Human Interface Guidelines recommend 44pt minimum
- Android Material Design recommends 48dp minimum
- 48px = 12mm = comfortable thumb target
- Bottom actions = one-thumb zone (75% of users)

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Easy to use with gloves
- ‚úÖ Reduces mis-taps
- ‚úÖ Accessible (WCAG compliant)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Larger UI footprint (fewer items per screen)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Standard web sizing (32-40px):** Rejected due to usability issues
- **Adaptive sizing:** Rejected due to complexity, inconsistency

**Implementation:**
- Created `components/mobile/` library
- All components default to 48px minimum
- See: `docs/MOBILE_COMPONENTS.md`

### **ADR-003: Mock Data for MVP, Real Database for Production**
**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è TEMPORARY

**Context:**
- Need to test UI/workflow without database
- Want to iterate quickly on design
- Will need real database for production

**Decision:**
- Use mock functions in `app/actions/` for MVP
- Mock returns success/failure based on input
- Store temporary data in localStorage for demo
- Plan migration to PostgreSQL for production

**Rationale:**
- Allows rapid prototyping
- Tests workflow logic without DB setup
- Can demo to stakeholders quickly
- Clear migration path

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Fast development iteration
- ‚úÖ No database setup overhead
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data doesn't persist across devices
- ‚ùå Cannot deploy to production as-is
- ‚ùå No data integrity guarantees

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **SQLite:** Rejected due to deployment complexity
- **Supabase:** Already removed (ADR-001)
- **Firebase:** Rejected due to vendor lock-in

**Migration Plan:**
1. [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
2. [ ] Create schema (see ADR-004)
3. [ ] Create `lib/db.ts` connection
4. [ ] Replace mock functions one-by-one
5. [ ] Add migration scripts
6. [ ] Test in staging

**Timeline:** Phase 1 (Week 1-2)

### **ADR-004: PostgreSQL as Primary Database**
**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** üìù PLANNED

**Context:**
- Need persistent data storage
- Need relational data (users, inspections, workflows)
- Need ACID guarantees for compliance
- May need to scale horizontally

**Decision:**
- Use PostgreSQL as primary database
- Host on Railway/Render/Supabase (just DB, not auth)
- Use Prisma ORM for type safety
- Store files/signatures in object storage (S3/Cloudflare R2)

**Rationale:**
- PostgreSQL is industry standard
- Excellent JSON support (for inspection items)
- Strong ACID guarantees
- Great tooling (pg_dump, migrations)
- Scales well

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Reliable, well-tested
- ‚úÖ Rich ecosystem
- ‚úÖ Good performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to manage migrations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Hosting cost (~$7-15/month)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **MySQL:** Similar, less JSON support
- **MongoDB:** Rejected due to lack of relations, weaker guarantees
- **SQLite:** Rejected due to deployment complexity

**Schema Design:**
```sql
-- See docs/SCHEMA.md for full schema
users (id, email, password_hash, role)
vehicles (id, number, type, vin)
inspections (id, driver_id, vehicle_id, type, items, mileage)
workflows (id, driver_id, status, clock_in, clock_out)
documents (id, driver_id, type, expiry_date, file_url)
```

**Implementation Timeline:** Week 1-2 (Phase 1)

### **ADR-005: Server Actions Over API Routes**
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Context:**
- Next.js 14 introduced server actions
- Need to submit forms and save data
- Want type safety between client/server

**Decision:**
- Use server actions (`'use server'`) for mutations
- Keep in `app/actions/` directory
- Return structured results: `{ success: boolean, data?, error? }`

**Rationale:**
- Type safe by default (shared types)
- No need for separate API routes
- Automatic request deduplication
- Better error handling

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Type safety
- ‚úÖ Less boilerplate
- ‚úÖ Automatic serialization
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Must be in server components or separate files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot use in client components directly

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **API Routes:** More flexible but requires manual type management
- **tRPC:** Too heavy for this project size

**Pattern:**
```typescript
// app/actions/inspections.ts
'use server'

export async function saveInspectionAction(data: InspectionData) {
  try {
    // Validate
    // Save to DB
    return { success: true, inspectionId: 'xxx' }
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: 'Failed to save' }
  }
}
```

### **ADR-006: Jest + React Testing Library for Testing**
**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Context:**
- Need testing framework
- Want to test React components
- Want fast test execution

**Decision:**
- Use Jest as test runner
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Use jsdom for browser environment
- Target 60%+ coverage for MVP, 80%+ for production

**Rationale:**
- Jest is industry standard
- React Testing Library encourages good practices
- Fast execution
- Good Next.js integration

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Well-documented
- ‚úÖ Large community
- ‚úÖ Good tooling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to mock Next.js router
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to configure for server actions

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Vitest:** Faster but less mature
- **Playwright:** Better for E2E but slower

**See:** `docs/TESTING.md` for full guide

### **ADR-007: No DVIR Signatures in MVP, Add in Phase 3**
**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ‚è≥ DEFERRED

**Context:**
- FMCSA requires driver signatures on DVIRs
- Signature capture is complex (canvas, touch, storage)
- Want to ship MVP quickly

**Decision:**
- Skip signature capture in MVP
- Add checkbox: "I certify this inspection is accurate"
- Store timestamp + driver ID as verification
- Add full signature component in Phase 3

**Rationale:**
- Reduces MVP complexity
- Still captures driver acknowledgment
- Can add signatures without breaking existing data
- Focus on core workflow first

**Consequences:**
- ‚úÖ Faster MVP delivery
- ‚úÖ Simpler initial implementation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not fully FMCSA compliant yet
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Will need migration when added

**Migration Plan:**
- [ ] Create signature component (canvas-based)
- [ ] Add signature column to inspections table
- [ ] Update inspection forms
- [ ] Backfill with "migrated" signatures for old data

**Timeline:** Phase 3 (Week 3-4)
