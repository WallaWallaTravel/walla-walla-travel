### 3. Verify All Logins Working

- [ ] **Test each driver account personally**
  ```
  Login as: evcritchlow@gmail.com
  Password: travel2024 (or their new password if changed)
  Test: Clock in/out, inspections
  ```

- [ ] **Check login activity in database**
  ```bash
  node -e "
  const { Pool } = require('pg');
  const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
  pool.query('SELECT email, last_login FROM users WHERE role=\\'driver\\' ORDER BY last_login DESC')
    .then(r => console.table(r.rows))
    .finally(() => pool.end());
  "
  ```

- [ ] **Follow up with non-responsive drivers**
  - Call them
  - Resend credentials if needed
  - Troubleshoot login issues

---

### 4. Password Security Enforcement

- [ ] **Verify all drivers changed default password**
  ```sql
  -- Check if password hashes are different from default
  -- (All should be unique after password changes)
  SELECT email, password_hash FROM users WHERE role = 'driver';
  ```

- [ ] **Send reminder to change passwords**
  - Text/call drivers who haven't changed yet
  - Explain importance of unique passwords
  - Offer help if needed

  ```

- [ ] **Update Sprinter 3 license plate** (when available)
  ```sql
