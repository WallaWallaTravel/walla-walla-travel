# 🎨 Uniquely Nicer Intake Form - Ideas & Spec

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Priority:** High - Improve customer experience

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

Create a **uniquely nicer** intake/booking form that:
- Feels premium and personalized
- Makes customers excited about their tour
- Captures all necessary information smoothly
- Sets us apart from competitors
- Works for both WallaWalla.Travel AND NW Touring & Concierge

## 💡 **Inspiration from Meta Prompting**

Key concepts to explore:
- **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed, when it's needed
- **Conversational flow** - Feel like a chat, not a form
- **Visual storytelling** - Show what they're booking (winery photos, etc.)
- **Smart defaults** - Pre-fill based on context
- **Personality** - Inject brand voice throughout
