## About Walla Walla Travel

Walla Walla Travel is a **destination management company (DMC)** based in Walla Walla, Washington. Founded by Ryan, a Walla Walla local with deep professional experience in the wine tour industry.

**What we do:** We plan and coordinate wine country experiences — from curated wine tours to private transportation — so guests can focus on the people they're with and the wines they're discovering.

**Our philosophy:** Relationships first. Wine country naturally encourages human connection, and we facilitate that by handling all the logistics so guests can focus on the moments that matter.

**Transportation partner:** All transportation is provided by **NW Touring & Concierge** (Northwest Touring LLC), a fully licensed and insured motor carrier (USDOT: 3603851, MC: 1225087). NW Touring operates luxury vehicles for charter and tour passenger service, both interstate and intrastate.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Booking & Logistics

**Q: How far in advance should I book?**
A: We recommend booking at least 2–4 weeks in advance, especially for weekend tours during peak season (May–October). Holiday weekends and special event weekends can book up months ahead.

**Q: Can I book for just 2 people?**
A: Absolutely! Our tours accommodate groups of all sizes from 1–14 guests. Couples are welcome on any tour option.

**Q: What if my group is larger than 14?**
A: Contact us directly and we'll arrange custom transportation with multiple vehicles.

**Q: How do I modify or cancel my booking?**
A: Contact us at info@wallawalla.travel or (509) 200-8000. See our cancellation and modification policies above for details.

### Tour Experience

**Q: How many wineries will we visit?**
A: The standard wine tour visits 3 wineries in 6 hours. For shorter tours, we offer 2 wineries + lunch in about 5 hours. We recommend no more than 3 wineries per tour to allow plenty of time at each stop.

**Q: Do I need to make winery reservations?**
A: We handle all winery reservations for Classic Wine Tours. For Private Transportation, we can help coordinate reservations or you can book your own.

**Q: Are tasting fees included?**
A: Tasting fees are NOT included in our tour pricing. Expect $15–$30 per person per winery. Many wineries waive the tasting fee with a wine purchase.

**Q: Can we stop for lunch?**
A: Yes! We strongly recommend a lunch break, especially on 6+ hour tours. We can recommend great restaurants and time the stop into your itinerary.

**Q: What should I wear?**
A: Smart casual is perfect. Comfortable shoes are a must — some wineries have gravel paths or outdoor areas. Layers are smart since temperatures can vary.

### Payment & Policies

**Q: When do I pay the balance?**
A: The remaining balance is due 48 hours AFTER your tour concludes. We're one of the few companies that lets you pay after your experience.

**Q: What happens if there's bad weather?**
A: If severe weather (snow, ice, flooding) makes touring unsafe, we offer a full refund or free reschedule. Light rain doesn't stop wine touring — most tastings are indoors!

**Q: Can I transfer my booking to someone else?**
A: Yes! If you can't make your tour date (especially within 21 days), you can transfer the booking to another person at no charge.

**Q: Is gratuity expected?**
A: Gratuity is appreciated but never required. If you had a great experience, 15% is a common amount. Our drivers work hard to make your day special.

### Wine Country Questions

**Q: I don't know much about wine. Is that okay?**
A: Absolutely! Many of our guests are new to wine tasting. Our drivers are knowledgeable and can recommend beginner-friendly wineries. The winery staff are welcoming and happy to guide you.

**Q: Can we bring kids?**
A: All guests at wineries must be 21+. If you're traveling with children, contact us to discuss family-friendly options in the area.

**Q: Can I buy wine and bring it on the tour?**
A: Yes! We provide a cooler in the vehicle specifically for your wine purchases. Buy as much as you'd like — that's what we're here for.
