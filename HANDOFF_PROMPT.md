I'm continuing work on the Walla Walla Travel driver management app. Please read these files to understand the current state:

1. `/Users/temp/walla-walla-final/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current project status
2. `/Users/temp/walla-walla-final/PHASES_ABC_COMPLETE.md` - What's been completed

## Quick Context

**Project:** Walla Walla Travel - Mobile-first driver management system  
**Location:** `/Users/temp/walla-walla-final`  
**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15, Heroku Postgres, Tailwind CSS  
**Fleet:** 3 Mercedes Sprinter vans (11-pax, 14-pax, 14-pax)  
**Drivers:** Owner, Eric Critchlow, Janine Bergevin  
**USDOT:** 3603851 (passenger carrier, FMCSA compliant)

## What's Done âœ…

### Phase A: Database âœ…
- Heroku Postgres fully configured
- 8 tables created: users, vehicles, time_cards, daily_trips, monthly_exemption_status, weekly_hos, company_info, inspections
- 3 drivers added, 3 vehicles added
- Functions and views created for compliance tracking

### Phase B: Mobile Components âœ…
- 5 production-ready components in `/components/mobile/`
- TouchButton, BottomActionBar, SignatureCanvas, MobileCard, AlertBanner
- All optimized for touch (48px+ buttons), haptic feedback, safe areas

### Phase C: Time Clock UI âœ…
- Clock in page: `/app/time-clock/clock-in/page.tsx`
- Dashboard: `/app/time-clock/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Both fully styled, need backend APIs

## What's Next ðŸŽ¯

**Priority 1: Build Backend APIs**
Need to create these API routes to connect UI to database:
- `/api/time-clock/clock-in` - POST to save time card
- `/api/time-clock/today` - GET current status
- `/api/drivers` - GET drivers from DB
- `/api/vehicles` - GET vehicles from DB

**Priority 2: Clock Out Page**
With signature capture, hour calculation, compliance check

**Priority 3: HOS Dashboard**
Visual tracking of hours, limits, exemption status

## Compliance Rules (Passenger Carrier)
- 10 hours max driving
- 15 hours max on-duty
- 8 hours min off-duty
- 60/70 hour weekly limits
- 150 air-mile exemption (8-day rule)

## Database Connection
- App: walla-walla-travel
- DATABASE_URL in `.env.local`
- Run `npm run db:verify` to check connection

## Test Current Pages
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/time-clock/dashboard
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/time-clock/clock-in
```

## What I Need Help With

[Tell Claude what you want to work on - examples:]
- "Build the backend APIs so clock in actually works"
- "Create the clock out page with signature"
- "Build the HOS dashboard"
- "Help me test the current pages"
- "Initialize GitHub and push everything"

**That's it! Claude will read the files and understand where we left off.**
