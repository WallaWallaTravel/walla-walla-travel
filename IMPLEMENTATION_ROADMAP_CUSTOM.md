**Day 3: User Testing**
```
Test Plan:
1. Have Eric complete full workflow on phone:
   - Clock in
   - Pre-trip inspection  
   - Log client pickup
   - Complete tour
   - Log client dropoff
   - Post-trip inspection
   - Clock out

2. Have Janine test on different phone:
   - Same workflow
   - Different vehicle
   
3. Test edge cases:
   - Trip exceeding 150 miles
   - Approaching 10-hour driving limit
   - Multiple trips same day
   - Vehicle out-of-service scenario
```

**Day 4: Refinements**
```
Based on user feedback:
- Adjust button sizes if needed
- Fix any UI issues
- Improve workflow if clunky
- Add missing features
```

**Day 5: Production Deployment**
```
Steps:
1. Final testing on all 3 devices
2. Deploy to production
3. Train all drivers (You, Eric, Janine)
4. Go live!
5. Monitor first week closely
```
