# üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN - October 13, 2025

## TWO CRITICAL ITEMS COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### 1. ‚úÖ GITHUB REPOSITORY SETUP

**Guide Created:** `/Users/temp/walla-walla-final/GITHUB_SETUP.md`

**Quick Start:**
```bash
cd /Users/temp/walla-walla-final

# Step 1: Create .gitignore (protects sensitive data)
# Follow instructions in GITHUB_SETUP.md

# Step 2: Initialize Git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Walla Walla Travel app with FMCSA compliance"

# Step 3: Create repo on GitHub (private!)
# Go to: https://github.com/new
# Name: walla-walla-travel

# Step 4: Connect and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/walla-walla-travel.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Security Reminder:** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- NEVER commit `.env.local` (contains database credentials)
- NEVER commit `node_modules/` (too large)
- Always use private repository (contains business logic)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ 150-MILE EXEMPTION DECISION

**Guide Created:** `/Users/temp/walla-walla-final/FMCSA_COMPLIANCE_GUIDE.md`

**ANSWER: YES! ‚úÖ You can use the 150-mile exemption!**

**Key Finding:**
Occasional trips beyond 150 miles DO NOT disqualify you from the exemption!

**How It Works:**
- **Most days:** Use simple time cards (within 150 air-miles) ‚úÖ
- **Occasional long trips:** Use paper logs for that day only ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Limit:** Can't exceed 150 miles more than 8 days per month ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **If over 8 days:** Must use ELD for that 30-day period ‚ùå

**Perfect for Wine Tours:**
```
Within 150 Air-Miles (172 road miles):
‚úÖ Walla Walla wineries (0-30 miles)
‚úÖ Tri-Cities (50 miles)
‚úÖ Red Mountain (120 miles)

Beyond 150 Air-Miles (need paper logs):
‚ö†Ô∏è Spokane (140 miles)
‚ö†Ô∏è Seattle (280 miles)
‚ö†Ô∏è Portland (240 miles)
```

**Your Situation:** Perfect! Most wine tours are local. A few long trips per year won't affect the exemption.
