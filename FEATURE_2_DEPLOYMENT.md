# FEATURE 2: Per-Shift Inspection Tracking - DEPLOYED ✅

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUE**: Post-trip inspections were tracked per DAY instead of per SHIFT.

**Problem**: If Driver A completed a post-trip at 2 PM, Driver B at 6 PM would see "Already completed" - unsafe!

**Solution**: Inspections are now tracked per TIME CARD (shift), not per day. Each driver MUST complete their own inspections.

## 📦 Changes Deployed to Production

### 1. **Inspection Actions** (`app/actions/inspections.ts`)
- ✅ Added `getActiveTimeCardId()` function to get current shift ID
- ✅ Updated `savePreTripInspection()` to save with `time_card_id`
- ✅ Updated `saveInspectionAction()` to save with `time_card_id`
- ✅ Updated `savePostTripInspection()` to save with `time_card_id`
- ✅ All functions now link inspections to specific shifts

### 2. **Clock-Out Validation** (`app/api/workflow/clock/route.ts`)
- ✅ **BLOCKS** clock-out if post-trip not completed for THIS shift
- ✅ Changed query from date-based to time_card_id-based
- ✅ Clear error message: "Post-Trip Inspection required before clocking out"

### 3. **Dashboard Display** (`app/workflow/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Shows current vehicle with VIN when clocked in
- ✅ Displays clock-in time
- ✅ Professional formatting with vehicle icon

## 🗄️ DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED

The database needs a new column to support per-shift tracking.

### Option 1: Run Migration via Heroku/RDS Console

```bash
# Connect to your database and run:
psql your_database_url

# Then paste the contents of migrations/001_add_time_card_id_to_inspections.sql
# Or run directly:
psql your_database_url < migrations/001_add_time_card_id_to_inspections.sql
```

### Option 2: Run via Database Client (TablePlus, DBeaver, etc.)

1. Connect to your AWS RDS database
2. Open `migrations/001_add_time_card_id_to_inspections.sql`
3. Execute the SQL script
4. You should see: ✅ Migration successful!

### Option 3: Run via Vercel (if you add DATABASE_URL env var)

```bash
# From your local terminal:
node scripts/add-time-card-to-inspections.cjs
```

### What the Migration Does:
- Adds `time_card_id` column to `inspections` table
- Creates indexes for faster queries
- Nullable for existing records (backwards compatible)

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Scenario: Two drivers, same vehicle, same day

**Before (UNSAFE):**
- 2:00 PM: Driver A completes post-trip, clocks out
- 6:00 PM: Driver B clocks in for evening shift
- 8:00 PM: Driver B tries to clock out
- ❌ System says "Post-trip already completed" (Driver A's inspection)
- ⚠️ Driver B never inspected the vehicle!

**After (SAFE):**
- 2:00 PM: Driver A completes post-trip (linked to their time_card_id=123), clocks out ✅
- 6:00 PM: Driver B clocks in for evening shift (new time_card_id=124)
- 8:00 PM: Driver B tries to clock out
- ❌ System blocks: "Post-Trip Inspection required before clocking out"
- Driver B must complete their OWN post-trip inspection (linked to time_card_id=124)
- ✅ Driver B completes post-trip, now can clock out

### Key Benefits:
1. **Safety**: Every driver inspects before AND after their shift
2. **Compliance**: Meets FMCSA requirements for pre/post-trip inspections
3. **Accountability**: Each inspection linked to specific driver & shift
4. **Clarity**: No confusion about whether inspection was done

## ✅ Testing Checklist

After running the migration, test these scenarios:

### Test 1: Single Driver
1. Driver clocks in → selects vehicle
2. Complete pre-trip inspection
3. Try to clock out → should be BLOCKED
4. Complete post-trip inspection
5. Clock out → should succeed

### Test 2: Multiple Drivers, Same Vehicle, Same Day
1. **Driver A Morning Shift**:
   - Clock in, complete pre-trip, complete post-trip, clock out ✅

2. **Driver B Afternoon Shift**:
   - Clock in to SAME vehicle
   - Must complete NEW pre-trip (even though Driver A did one) ✅
   - Try to clock out → BLOCKED (needs post-trip) ✅
   - Complete post-trip ✅
   - Clock out → succeeds ✅

### Test 3: Dashboard Display
1. Clock in with vehicle
2. Check dashboard → should show:
   - Vehicle: 🚐 Sprinter 1 (Mercedes-Benz Sprinter)
   - VIN: WIZAKEHYOSP793096
   - Clocked in: 10:26 AM

## 🚨 Error Handling

If the migration hasn't been run yet, users will see:
```
"Database schema update required. Please contact administrator."
```

This prevents data corruption and makes it clear what needs to be done.

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Run the database migration** (see options above)
2. **Test with 2 drivers** (Eric and Janine/Ryan)
3. **Verify clock-out is blocked** without post-trip
4. **Confirm dashboard** shows vehicle info
