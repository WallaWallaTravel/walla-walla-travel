# üö® FMCSA COMPLIANCE GUIDE - 150 AIR-MILE EXEMPTION

**For:** Walla Walla Travel - Wine Tour Operations  
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Critical Decision:** Can we use the 150-mile exemption with occasional longer trips?

---

## ‚úÖ EXCELLENT NEWS: YES, YOU CAN USE THE EXEMPTION!

**Answer:** You CAN use the 150 air-mile exemption even if you have occasional trips beyond 150 miles!

**Key Rule:** You don't lose the exemption permanently. On days you exceed 150 air-miles, you must use paper logs or ELDs for that specific day. On days you stay within the radius, you can use the simplified time-card system.

---

## üìè WHAT IS THE 150 AIR-MILE EXEMPTION?

### **Definition:**
An "air mile" is a nautical measurement of distance that excludes any twists or turns - it's the straight-line distance "as the crow flies" between two points.

**150 air-miles = approximately 172.6 road miles**

### **Who Qualifies:**
As of 2020, the 150 air-mile exemption is for property-carrying and passenger-carrying drivers who:
- Operate within a 150 air-mile radius of their work reporting location
- Return to their work reporting location at the end of each duty day
- Are on duty for 14 hours or less
- Have at least 10 consecutive hours off-duty between each duty day

### **What You're Exempt From:**
When you qualify:
- No Electronic Logging Device (ELD) required
- No detailed Records of Duty Status (RODS) required
- No mandatory 30-minute break after 8 hours of driving
- Only need simple time cards showing start/end times

---

## üîë THE CRITICAL "8 DAYS IN 30 DAYS" RULE

### **Here's How It Works:**

**SCENARIO 1: Occasional Long Trips (1-8 days per month)** ‚úÖ
If you exceed the 150 air-mile radius on 8 days or fewer within any 30-day period:
- Use paper logs ONLY on those specific days you exceed the radius
- Continue using time cards on all other days
- You keep the exemption!

**Example for Wine Tours:**
```
Month of October 2025:
- Days 1-10: Local tours within 150 miles ‚Üí Use time cards ‚úÖ
- Day 11: Portland trip (200 miles) ‚Üí Use paper logs ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Days 12-25: Local tours within 150 miles ‚Üí Use time cards ‚úÖ
- Day 26: Seattle trip (250 miles) ‚Üí Use paper logs ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Days 27-31: Local tours within 150 miles ‚Üí Use time cards ‚úÖ

Result: Only 2 days required paper logs ‚Üí Still exempt! ‚úÖ
```

**SCENARIO 2: Frequent Long Trips (9+ days per month)** ‚ùå
If you exceed the 150 air-mile radius MORE than 8 days in any 30-day period:
- You must install and use ELDs for the remainder of that 30-day cycle
- After the 30-day period ends, you can return to time cards if you stay within 8 days again

**Example - Exceeding Limit:**
```
Month of November 2025:
- 9 days with trips beyond 150 miles

Result: Must use ELD for all of November (including local days) ‚ùå
After November ends: Can return to time cards if December stays under 8 days ‚úÖ
```

## üéØ PERFECT FOR WINE TOURS!

### **Why This Works for Your Business:**

**Walla Walla Wine Tours are Ideal:**
- Most wineries are within 50 miles of Walla Walla
- Most tours return same day
- Typical tour: 30-100 road miles total
- Well within 150 air-mile radius!

**Wine Tour Destinations from Walla Walla:**
```
Within 150 Air-Miles (172 road miles): ‚úÖ
- Walla Walla AVA wineries: 0-30 miles ‚úÖ
- Tri-Cities area: ~50 miles ‚úÖ
- Milton-Freewater, OR: ~20 miles ‚úÖ
- Columbia Valley wineries: ~75 miles ‚úÖ
- Horse Heaven Hills: ~90 miles ‚úÖ
- Red Mountain: ~120 miles ‚úÖ

Beyond 150 Air-Miles (Need Logs): ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Spokane: ~140 miles (paper logs required)
- Seattle: ~280 miles (paper logs required)
- Portland: ~240 miles (paper logs required)
```

---

## üìã WHAT YOU NEED TO TRACK

### **For Days WITHIN 150 Miles (Most Days):**

**Time Card Requirements:**
Simple time card or timesheet showing:
- Driver name
- Date
- Start time (when reporting to work)
- End time (when released from work)
- Total hours on duty
- Location where driver reports (e.g., "Walla Walla office")

**Example Time Card:**
```
Driver: John Doe
Date: October 13, 2025
Report Location: Walla Walla Travel Office, 123 Main St
Start Time: 8:00 AM
End Time: 5:30 PM
Total Hours: 9.5 hours
Signature: [Driver signature]
```

### **For Days BEYOND 150 Miles (Occasional):**

**Paper Log Requirements:**
When you exceed the radius, you must keep detailed Records of Duty Status (RODS) showing:
- All on-duty time
- All driving time
- Off-duty time
- Sleeper berth time (if applicable)
- Take mandatory 30-minute break after 8 hours of driving
- Cannot drive after 14 hours on duty

---

## üöó RECOMMENDED SYSTEM FOR YOUR BUSINESS

### **Option 1: Flexible System (RECOMMENDED)**

**Default Mode: 150-Mile Exemption**
- Use time cards for typical wine tours
- Simple, no ELD needed
- Less paperwork
- Easier for drivers

**When Needed: Paper Logs**
- Keep blank paper logs in vehicles
- Drivers use them ONLY when exceeding 150 miles
- Track to ensure staying under 8 days/month

**Database Tracking:**
```sql
-- Track which method was used each day
CREATE TABLE daily_hos_records (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  driver_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  method VARCHAR(20), -- 'time_card' or 'paper_log'
  start_time TIME,
  end_time TIME,
  total_hours DECIMAL(4,2),
  exceeded_radius BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  furthest_location TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  UNIQUE(driver_id, date)
);

-- Count days per month needing logs
SELECT 
  driver_id,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', date) as month,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE exceeded_radius = true) as days_needing_logs
FROM daily_hos_records
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY driver_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', date);
```

### **Option 2: Always Use ELDs (Not Recommended for You)**

**Pros:**
- No need to track exemption status
- More detailed data

**Cons:**
- More expensive ($40-70/month per vehicle)
- More complex
- Unnecessary for mostly local operations

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT RULES THAT ALWAYS APPLY

**Even with the 150-mile exemption, you MUST still:**

1. **Driver Licensing:**
   Maintain appropriate CDL or driver's license for vehicle type

2. **Medical Certificates:**
   Keep current DOT medical cards

3. **Vehicle Inspections:**
   Complete required vehicle inspections and maintain permits/registrations

4. **Pre-Trip and Post-Trip Inspections:**
   - ALWAYS required by FMCSA
   - Must be completed regardless of exemption status
   - Digital or paper records required

5. **DVIR (Driver Vehicle Inspection Report):**
   - Required when defects are found
   - Must be signed by driver
   - Must be reviewed and signed by mechanic when repaired

6. **Hours Limits (Always Apply):**
   - Cannot drive more than 11 hours total
   - Cannot drive after being on duty for 14 hours

  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
  const airMiles = R * c;
  
  return airMiles;
}

// Check if trip exceeds exemption
function checkExemptionStatus(
  baseLocation: Location,
  tripLocations: Location[]
): { 
  exceeded: boolean; 
  maxDistance: number; 
  requiresLogs: boolean 
} {
  const maxDistance = Math.max(
