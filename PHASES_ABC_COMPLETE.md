## üöÄ WHAT TO DO NEXT

### Step 1: Test the Pages (5 minutes)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit in your browser:

1. **Unified Dashboard:**  
   http://localhost:3000/time-clock/dashboard

2. **Clock In Page:**  
   http://localhost:3000/time-clock/clock-in

Test on your phone for best experience!

### Step 2: Connect to Database APIs

The pages are fully built with UI, but need backend APIs. I need to create:

**API Routes to Build:**
- `/api/time-clock/clock-in` - POST to create time card
- `/api/time-clock/clock-out` - POST to complete time card
- `/api/time-clock/today` - GET current status
- `/api/time-clock/hos` - GET HOS compliance data
- `/api/drivers` - GET list of drivers
- `/api/vehicles` - GET list of vehicles

Would you like me to build these APIs now?

### Step 3: Complete Clock Out Page

Need to create:
- Clock out page with signature
- Hour calculation
- Compliance check
- PDF generation

### Step 4: HOS Dashboard

- Visual display of hours
- Compliance alerts
- 150-mile exemption tracking
- Weekly/monthly summaries
