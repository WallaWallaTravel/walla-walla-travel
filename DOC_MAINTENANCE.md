# 🔄 DOCUMENTATION MAINTENANCE GUIDE
**Purpose:** Keep documentation accurate, current, and useful over time

**The Problem:** Documentation rots. Code changes, docs don't. Within weeks, docs become misleading.  
**The Solution:** Systematic maintenance process that makes updating docs effortless.

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**"Documentation is code"**
- If code changes without tests updating → tests fail → CI fails → can't merge
- If code changes without docs updating → docs rot → confusion → wasted time

**Solution:** Make documentation updates PART of every code change, not separate.

---

## 📋 UPDATE RULES

### MUST Update (Every Time)

#### When You Add/Change Code:
```bash
1. Make code change
2. Update relevant docs (see matrix below)
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Commit BOTH code + docs together
```

#### When You Fix a Bug:
```bash
1. Fix the bug
2. Add solution to TROUBLESHOOTING.md
3. Update CHANGELOG.md
4. Commit together
```

#### When You Make Architecture Decision:
```bash
1. Make the decision
2. Create ADR in DECISIONS.md
3. Update ARCHITECTURE.md if structure changes
4. Update MASTER_STATUS.md if impacts current state
5. Update CHANGELOG.md
6. Commit together
```

## 🚫 COMMON DOCUMENTATION MISTAKES

### ❌ Don't Do This:

**Vague updates:**
```markdown
❌ "Updated some files"
❌ "Fixed stuff"
❌ "Made improvements"
```

**Outdated info:**
```markdown
❌ Leaving old instructions that don't work
❌ Not updating "Last Updated" dates
❌ Referencing removed features
```

**Incomplete docs:**
```markdown
❌ "TODO: Add this later"
❌ "Coming soon"
❌ Blank sections with headers
```

### ✅ Do This Instead:

**Clear updates:**
```markdown
✅ "feat: add signature component to DVIR"
✅ "fix: resolve login redirect loop"
✅ "docs: update database setup instructions"
```

**Current info:**
```markdown
✅ Update docs WHEN code changes
✅ Always update "Last Updated" date
✅ Remove docs for removed features
```

**Complete docs:**
```markdown
✅ Write documentation BEFORE feature ships
✅ Fill in placeholders immediately
✅ Delete sections you won't fill
```

## 🔍 DOCUMENTATION DEBT DETECTION

### Signs Documentation Needs Work:

**Red Flags:**
- 🚩 "Last Updated" >3 months ago
- 🚩 Code changed but doc didn't
- 🚩 Multiple people ask same question
- 🚩 Instructions don't work
- 🚩 Links return 404
- 🚩 Examples use old API
- 🚩 TODO markers older than 1 week

### How to Fix:

1. **Schedule dedicated doc time**
   - Block 2 hours/month for documentation
   - Treat as high priority (like fixing bugs)

2. **Fix as you go**
   - See outdated doc → fix immediately
   - Just found answer → document immediately
   - Just solved issue → add to TROUBLESHOOTING immediately

3. **Pair documentation with code changes**
   - PR checklist includes "docs updated"
   - Code review includes doc review
   - CI checks for updated "Last Updated" dates (future)

---

## 🎯 MAKING DOC UPDATES EASY

### Use Git Hooks (Optional)

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Remind to update docs

changed_files=$(git diff --cached --name-only)

if echo "$changed_files" | grep -q "^app/\|^lib/\|^components/"; then
  if ! echo "$changed_files" | grep -q "\.md$"; then
    echo "⚠️  WARNING: Code changed but no docs updated"
    echo "   Consider updating:"
    echo "   - CHANGELOG.md"
    echo "   - MASTER_STATUS.md (if major change)"
    echo "   - Relevant docs in /docs/"
    echo ""
    read -p "Continue anyway? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
    echo
    if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
fi
```

### Use Commit Template

Create `.gitmessage`:
```
# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# Body: What and why (not how)
#
# Docs updated:
# - [ ] CHANGELOG.md
# - [ ] Relevant doc in /docs/
# - [ ] MASTER_STATUS.md (if major)
#
# Closes #issue
```

Then: `git config commit.template .gitmessage`

## 📊 DOCUMENTATION QUALITY METRICS

### How to Measure:

**Coverage:**
```bash
# Count documented vs undocumented areas
# Goal: 90%+ coverage
```

**Freshness:**
```bash
# Check "Last Updated" dates
grep "Last Updated" *.md docs/*.md | sort

# Goal: All <3 months old
```

**Accuracy:**
```bash
# Test instructions work
# Follow setup guide from scratch
# Try all code examples
# Click all links

# Goal: 100% instructions work
```

**Findability:**
```bash
# Time how long to find information
# Ask new team member to find X
# Goal: <5 minutes to find anything
```

## 🔄 DOCUMENTATION LIFECYCLE

### Stages:

```
1. DRAFT → Being written, not reviewed
2. REVIEW → Ready for feedback
3. ACTIVE → Current, accurate, being used
4. STALE → >3 months old, needs review
5. OUTDATED → Incorrect, needs rewrite
6. ARCHIVED → Historical, moved to /archive/
7. DELETED → No longer needed
```

### When to Archive:

✅ Archive when:
- Feature removed
- Process changed
- Decision superseded
- Info no longer relevant BUT historically interesting

❌ Don't archive:
- Current information
- Frequently referenced docs
- Core system documentation

### When to Delete:

✅ Delete when:
- Completely wrong/misleading
- Duplicate of better doc
- No historical value
- Test/scratch files

❌ Don't delete:
- Might need for reference
- Explains past decisions
- Someone might need it

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### 1. Documentation as Code
```bash
# Treat docs like code
git diff CHANGELOG.md  # Review before committing
npm run docs:test      # Test docs (future)
```

### 2. Make It Part of Definition of Done
```markdown
Feature is done when:
- [ ] Code written
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Docs updated ← THIS!
- [ ] Deployed
```

### 3. Use TODO Comments
```markdown
<!-- TODO: Update this section after Phase 2 -->
```

Then grep for them:
```bash
grep -r "TODO" *.md docs/*.md
```

### 4. Screenshot Everything
- Before/after for UI changes
- Error messages for troubleshooting
- Terminal output for commands

### 5. Learn from Questions
- Someone asks question → Check if doc explains it
- If not → Add explanation
- Same question twice → Doc needs work
