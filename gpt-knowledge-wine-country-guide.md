## Walla Walla Wine Region Overview

Walla Walla Valley is one of the **premier wine regions in the Pacific Northwest** and among the most acclaimed in the United States. Located in southeastern Washington (extending slightly into northeastern Oregon), this region has earned a reputation for producing world-class wines — particularly bold reds.

### Key Stats

| **AVA established** | 1984 |

### Why Walla Walla?

- **Climate:** Hot days, cool nights — ideal for developing complex flavors in grapes. 2,800–3,200 growing degree days with up to 17 hours of summer daylight.
- **Soils:** A unique mix of loess (wind-blown silt), basalt, and alluvial deposits that give wines distinctive character.
- **Heritage:** Nearly 50 years of winemaking history, from the pioneering Leonetti Cellar to today's 120+ producers.
- **Intimacy:** Unlike Napa Valley's corporate feel, Walla Walla wineries are often family-owned, and you'll frequently meet the winemaker pouring your tasting.
- **Walkability:** Downtown alone has 30+ tasting rooms within walking distance.

## Signature Wine Varieties

Walla Walla is **red wine country**, though excellent whites are produced too.

### The Big Three

**1. Cabernet Sauvignon** — The King
- Bold, age-worthy, structured
- Walla Walla Cabs rival Napa in quality
- Look for: dark fruit, firm tannins, long finish
- Best from: Westside, The Rocks District, established producers

**2. Syrah** — The Signature
- Walla Walla's claim to fame nationally
- Peppery, complex, with dark fruit and savory notes
- The Rocks District Syrah is particularly renowned (the cobblestone soils create intense, mineral-driven wines)
- Look for: black pepper, smoked meat, blackberry

**3. Merlot** — The Approachable One
- Soft, fruit-forward, easy to enjoy
- Often the best entry point for new wine drinkers
- Look for: plum, cherry, chocolate, velvety texture

### Also Outstanding

| Variety | Style | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Bordeaux Blends** | Rich, complex reds | Cabernet + Merlot + Cab Franc blends are a Walla Walla specialty |
| **Cabernet Franc** | Aromatic, herbal | Increasingly recognized as a standalone variety here |
| **Tempranillo** | Spanish-style red | Emerging variety showing great promise in the region |
| **Chardonnay** | Both oaked and unoaked | Crisp styles gaining popularity alongside traditional buttery versions |
| **Viognier** | Aromatic white | Stone fruit, floral — a lovely summer wine |

### Tasting Order Tip

When visiting wineries, taste in this order: **whites → rosés → lighter reds → bold reds → dessert wines**. This protects your palate and lets you appreciate each wine fully.

## Wine Tasting Basics

For guests new to wine tasting or planning their first Walla Walla visit:

### What to Expect

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Tasting fees** | $15–$30 per person per winery (varies) |
| **Duration per winery** | 45–80 minutes |
| **Reservations** | Recommended, especially weekends and smaller wineries |
| **Wines per tasting** | Typically 5–7 wines |
| **Fee waiver** | Many wineries waive the tasting fee with a bottle purchase |

### How Many Wineries Per Day?

**We strongly recommend 3–4 wineries maximum per day.** Here's why:

- Each tasting takes 45–80 minutes when done right
- You need time to travel between stops
- A lunch break is essential (both for enjoyment and responsible drinking)
- Wine fatigue is real — your palate and energy decrease after 4 stops
- Quality over quantity leads to better memories and discoveries

### Winery Etiquette

- **Make reservations** — many Walla Walla wineries are small and require them
- **Arrive on time** — late arrivals may lose their slot
- **Use the spit bucket** — it's there for a reason and nobody judges you
- **Ask questions** — tasting room staff love sharing their knowledge
- **Don't wear strong perfume** — it interferes with wine aromas
- **Tip your host** — $5–$10 per person is appreciated at smaller wineries

## Insider Tips

These tips come from extensive local experience:

### At the Wineries

1. **Start with lighter wines, work to bold** — your palate will thank you
2. **A lunch break is essential** — it resets your palate and keeps energy up
3. **Don't skip the whites** — Walla Walla is known for reds, but the Chardonnays and Viogniers are hidden gems
4. **Talk to the staff** — smaller wineries often have the winemaker pouring. Ask questions — they love sharing
5. **Use the spit bucket without shame** — professionals do it. It lets you taste more and enjoy the whole day
6. **Buy what you love** — if a wine moves you, buy it. You may not find it again (many are small-production)

### Planning Your Day

7. **3–4 wineries is the sweet spot** — more than that and fatigue sets in
8. **Mix neighborhoods** — visit one downtown tasting room and one or two rural estates for variety
9. **Make reservations** — especially on weekends and at smaller wineries. Walk-ins are increasingly difficult
10. **Allow 45–80 minutes per winery** — rushing defeats the purpose

### Practical Tips

11. **Bring a cooler** (or we provide one) — Walla Walla summers are hot, and wine in a hot car is ruined wine
12. **Wear comfortable shoes** — gravel paths, vineyard walks, and standing add up
13. **Eat breakfast** — never taste on an empty stomach
14. **Bring water** (we provide bottled water on all tours)
15. **Shipping is easy** — most wineries will ship purchases home. Ask about case discounts

### Best-Kept Secrets

16. **Weekday visits** mean smaller crowds and more personal attention from tasting room staff
17. **The Airport District** is underrated — great wines in a casual, walkable setting
18. **Eastside/Mill Creek** has the best views in the valley — worth the drive for a special tasting
19. **Many wineries offer wine club perks** — if you love a producer, the club often includes free tastings, discounts, and member-only wines
20. **Red Mountain day trips** offer a completely different terroir experience — ask us about combining both regions
